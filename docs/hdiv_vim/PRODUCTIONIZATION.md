# HDiv-type VIM — productionization roadmap (the path to retire yano-type)

The HDiv-type VIM method is validated (see [README.md](README.md), feec suite 85/85). This document is
the roadmap to make it a **shipped production solver that retires the yano-type distortion elements** —
i.e. a drop-in MMM/MSC replacement that is at-least-as-good as the shipped solver on **every** case
yano-type handles, behind a clean Radia API. Honest scope, milestone-based, with a hard
**definition-of-done** (the parity gate).

## Current state (inventory, 2026-06-08)

| Layer | C++ (compiled, `_radia_pybind.pyd`) | Python-only (prototype) |
|---|---|---|
| Charge map B + HDiv mass | structured **hex** (`rad_hdiv_vim.cpp`) | unstructured **tet** (NGSolve HDiv extraction, `examples/feec_vim/`) |
| Coulomb Gram G | monopole + sub-point (`CoulombGramEntry`) | Wilton surface + `phi_tet` volume (analytic) |
| Scalable Gram H-matrix | **`_ChargeGramHMatrix`** (general/unstructured), `_HDivVimHMatrix` (hex) | (assembly driven from Python) |
| H-LDLᵀ factorization | cHACApK (`_hldlt_self_test*`, `factor_solve_hldlt`) | (not wired into the material-system apply) |
| Linear solve (MINRES) | — | scipy / hand-coded |
| Nonlinear damped Newton | — | `solve_nonlinear_newton` |
| Curved + high-order Gram | — (uses NGSolve) | `ngsolve.bem` single-layer |
| Symmetry image method | — | `hdiv_demag_symmetry_image.py` |
| **Public Radia API** | **none** (only `_hdiv_vim_*` test symbols) | examples/feec_vim scripts |

So the **scalable Gram + H-LDLᵀ foundation is already C++**; the gap is the unstructured production
pipeline (assembly orchestration, accurate Gram entries, the solve loop) + a shipped API + the parity
gate (esp. **speed**, never measured).

## Definition of done — the parity gate (M0)

yano-type is sealed **only when** HDiv-VIM is at-least-as-good on the full case matrix the shipped MSC
handles, measured head-to-head:

| Case | Accuracy criterion | Speed criterion |
|---|---|---|
| Linear soft iron (mu_r 10–1e5), convex + non-convex | match shipped MSC to its mesh-converged value | wall-clock within ~2x of MSC (target: faster) |
| Nonlinear BH iron (cube, C-yoke, real table) | match MSC volume-avg `<1%` (done at prototype level) | within ~2x |
| Permanent magnet + soft iron (mixed) | match MSC | within ~2x |
| IMA symmetry 1/4, 1/8 | match the full model | fewer DOF → faster |
| Distorted meshes (high distortion) | mu_r-independent (done) + correct values | bounded iters (done) |
| Standard validation set (the lab's MSC golden problems) | parity | parity |

**M0 deliverable**: (1) enumerate the exact golden problems above into a `tests/feec/parity_vs_msc/`
suite; (2) **measure the speed gap honestly** — isolate the *algorithm* from the Python orchestration:
time the C++ `_ChargeGramHMatrix` demag MatVec + the iteration count vs the shipped MSC interaction
MatVec at matched N (the orchestration becomes C++ in production, so the per-MatVec + iters are the
production-representative numbers). This sizes the C++ lift and fixes the "done" bar.

## Milestones

- **M0 — parity gate + speed-gap measurement** *(START HERE; mostly measurement, low risk).* The
  definition-of-done above + the honest speed number. Until M0, "retire yano-type" is conference-ready
  (validated method) but the production gap is unquantified.
- **M1 — production module + public Radia API.** Move the validated solve out of `examples/feec_vim/`
  into `src/radia/` with a clean entry (e.g. `rad.hdiv_demag_solve(mesh, materials, source)`), driving
  the existing C++ `_ChargeGramHMatrix` + the Newton. Golden-test against the examples' validated
  numbers. Makes HDiv-VIM a usable Radia feature (first shippable step).
- **M2 — accurate Gram in the C++ scalable path.** Move the Wilton surface + `phi_tet` volume Gram into
  the C++ `_ChargeGramHMatrix` entry function (currently monopole in C++, accurate Gram is a Python
  overlay). The scalable H-matrix path must be as accurate as the dense Python reference.
- **M3 — nonlinear Newton in C++.** The per-cell tensor-tangent damped Newton loop (or its hot parts)
  in C++, reusing the C++ H-LDLᵀ for the factor-once tangent solve. Removes the Python per-iteration
  overhead — the main speed lever for nonlinear.
- **M4 — curved/high-order + symmetry production + the curved-nonlinear-volume gap.** Wire the
  `ngsolve.bem` single-layer (curved Gram) + the symmetry image method + a true reduced-DOF symmetry-BC
  solve into the API. Build the genuine method gap: the curved nonlinear **volume** charge (`phi_tet` on
  curved cells; `ngsolve.bem` is boundary-only).
- **M5 — the seal.** HDiv-VIM passes the M0 parity gate on the full matrix → flip the production
  default, deprecate + seal yano-type (preserve in the private ELF repo, per the original plan).

## Honest unknowns / risks

- **Speed** is the one unmeasured quantity and the gating risk. At lowest order HDiv-VIM ≈ shipped MSC
  algorithmically (same demag spectrum); the raw-speed *win* needs high-order. The *loss* risk is the
  H-matrix constant factors + the Newton orchestration. M0 measures it before committing M2/M3 effort.
- **Curved nonlinear volume charge** has no clean analytic reference (Radia facets curved geometry), so
  M4's curved-nonlinear validation is mesh-convergence / self-consistency, not vs-truth.
- The Wilton/`phi_tet` Gram may be adequate to keep **NGSolve-side / Python** (the loops are not the hot
  path); M2's C++ port is justified only if the speed-gap (M0) demands it.

## Sequencing note

M0 → M1 are the immediate, low-risk, high-value steps (measure the gap; ship a usable API). M2/M3 (the
heavy C++) are justified *by M0's speed number*. Do M0 first — it converts "retire yano-type" from a
goal into a quantified, executable plan.
